# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help the ride-sharing company, PyBer, improve access to their services and determine affordability for different neighborhoods. This analysis project focuses on investigating the differences in ride-sharing data among areas of differing population densities, using a ride data summary and a multi-line chart to glean insights.

## Results
### Summary Dataframe of Ride Share Data by Population Density

- Rural communities have the least number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Rural communities also have the greatest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
- In contrast, urban communities have the greatest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares, as well as the least average far per ride and average far per driver.
- The ride sharing data for suburban communities falls in between the data we see in rural and urban communities.

- PyBer is bringing in the largest portion of it's total fares from urban communities, and the smallest portion from rural communities.
- Over the four month period that was analyzed, total fares remained fairly consistent within each city type through time.

## Summary
### Recommendations
1. To address the stark difference amount total riders in urban versus rural communities, PyBer could focus more marketing resources on reaching out to underrepresented rural (and suburban) residents.
2. If PyBer wishes to increase the total amount of riders in rural communities, it should also make efforts to increase the pool of drivers available in rural cities. Currently there are nearly 31 times as many drivers in urban cities than rural cities. Compared to 13 times more riders in urban cities than rural cities, it is clear that a contributing factor to less rural riders is a lack of rural drivers.
3. Finally, there is a clear price disparancy in the average fare per ride among the different city types, with the average fare in urban cities being about 1.4 times greater than that in rural cities. In order to address this difference, PyBer could change their fare calculation to account for time loss due to urban traffic or increase the base cost of a ride.
